# SoftSSD-Platform

## Overview

### Feature

![SoftSSD Architecture](Pic/SoftSSD.jpg)

* Our SSD development platform is built around the **Xilinx Zynq® UltraScale+™ MPSoC** as the core board. 
* This device features a heterogeneous computing architecture, integrating programmable **ARM Cortex® application processors** with a high-performance **FPGA fabric** on a single chip.
   * This combination enables flexible and efficient execution of both control-plane tasks (on the ARM cores) and data-plane acceleration (in the FPGA logic).
* More features can be found in [Introduction to SoftSSD](/Guide/Intro.md).

### Price: 25,000 HKD
